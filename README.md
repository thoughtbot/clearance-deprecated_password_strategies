# clearance-deprecated_password_strategies

This gem contains the three password strategies deprecated in Clearance 1.10.0:

* Clearance::PasswordStrategies::Blowfish
* Clearance::PasswordStrategies::SHA1
* Clearance::PasswordStrategies::BCryptMigrationFromSHA1

These strategies were removed from Clearance because we no longer use or
maintain them.

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clearance-deprecated_password_strategies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
